#
Image analyzer is an interface that simplifies interaction with image-related deep learning models. The interface has built-in features that get adjusted based on the models. You need to set the destination folder that contains your models with specific pattern names. The built-in features will use the names. 

The interface was initially part of an internal project that detects abusive content with the possibility of tracing the subjects.

# Name structue
- [Name]			  Name of the model
- [Info]			  Description
- [Categories]	Your model categories (if any)
- [Number]		  Model place
- .h5				    Model extention

#### E.g.
The following are examples of the model generated automatically by QeeqBox Automated Deep Learning System for large files. The examples are included in this project

- [Model 3.224x][Find safe, maybe and unsafe images 3.224][safe unsafe][1].h5
- [Model 2.224x][Find safe and unsafe images 2.224][safe maybe unsafe][2].h5
